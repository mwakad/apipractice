# Using APIs 

## Introduction 

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and exchange information with each other without needing to know the intricate details of how each application works internally. APIs are incredibly valuable tools in the data science workflow, enabling access to a vast amount of data and functionalities that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain. 

## Applications in Data Science

APIs are leveraged in Data Science for:

<strong> 1: </strong> Data Acquisition

<strong> 2: </strong> Feature Engineering

<strong> 3: </strong> Model Deployment and Integration

<strong> 4: </strong> Automation and Workflow Management

## Project Description

I use a Public API (OpenWeatherMap) to fetch weather data for Nairobi city. After featching the data I perform a simple data manipulation using the Pandas library. 

## Function

Enter you API key generated from https://openweathermap.org/

Replace `city_name` with your desired city name

Replace the city's respective `country_code`

Execute
